        <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
        <p>A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.</p>
        <p>Malala went through hardships at a young age and was not allowed to have an education only because she was a girl. Since she was young she has been bringing awareness to the social and economic impact of girls' education. In December 2014, she became the youngest-ever Nobel Peace Prize Laureate.</p>
