        <h1>Internet Humor</h1>
        <h3>by Meadow D'Arcy</h3>
        <p>The internet is a great venue for humor. This page contains some funny things that might make you laugh.</p>
        

        <h2>Top Laugh</h2>
        <p>When I think of funny videos on the web, this is usually the first type of video that comes to mind. And also makes me smile.</p>

        <h2><em>Sometimes</em> Fresh Laughs</h2>
        <p>Chat GBT is honestly really hilarious when it comes asking them to take a picture and remove something. For example if you ask to see a hamburger with pickles and then ask Chat GBT to take them away. For some reason the AI can't do it.</p>

        <h2>Old Laughs</h2>
        <p>When I think of a webiste I used that hused to make me laugh it had to be Vine. Now vine is unfortunatley not around. Here is a video of some of the best memes from vine. </p>
